One of the easiest ways to mislead an audience is by manipulating axis scaling.

In this facet plot, all regions share the same Y-axis range, which means Syria (with the highest refugee count) dictates the scale. @cr-facet

::: {#cr-facet}
```{r}
# Define the desired order of regions
desired_order <- c(
  "Syrian Arab Rep.", "Afghanistan", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
  "Dem. Rep. of the Congo", "Yemen"
)
# Reorder the coo_name column
conflict_regions$coo_name <- factor(conflict_regions$coo_name, levels = desired_order)


ggplot(conflict_regions, aes(
  x = year, y = total_refugees,
  colour = coo_name
)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.75) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = region_colors
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2022, by = 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "<b>Refugees (Millions)</b> Over Time by Country",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    color = "Country of Origin"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~coo_name, scales = "free_x") + # Independent scaling of x-axis
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"), # Make facet labels bold
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    panel.spacing = unit(0.85, "cm"),
    plot.title = ggtext::element_markdown(size = 12, hjust = 0.1) # Enable Markdown for the title

In first row, we see the immense scale of displacement in Syria and Afghanistan [@cr-facet]{pan-to="-15%,20%" scale-by="1.8"}

But in 2nd row, regions like Sudan and Congo appear to show only minor fluctuations [@cr-facet]{pan-to="5%,-30%" scale-by="1.8"}


But is it really the case in these countries!?

Let's take these one by one by comparing their facet vs individual plots
::::

```{r, echo=F}
# List of regions you want to compare
region_names <- c("Myanmar", "Sudan", "Dem. Rep. of the Congo", "Yemen")

for (region in region_names) {
  # Filter data for the region
  region_data <- conflict_regions %>%
    filter(coo_name == region)

  # Mini plot from facet chart (fixed scaling)
  facet_plot <- ggplot(region_data, aes(x = year, y = total_refugees, colour = coo_name)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +
    scale_color_manual(
      values = region_colors
    ) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2022, by = 4)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(conflict_regions$total_refugees))) +
    labs(

      y = "Refugees (in <b>Millions</b>)"

      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      legend.position = "none",
      plot.margin = unit(c(0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9), "cm"),
      axis.title.y = ggtext::element_markdown()
    )

  # Independent plot (auto-scaled)
  individual_plot <- ggplot(region_data, aes(x = year, y = total_refugees, colour = coo_name)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +

    ) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2022, by = 4)) +
    labs(

      axis.title.y = ggtext::element_markdown()
    )

  # Combine the two plots side by side
  combined_plot <- facet_plot + individual_plot +
    plot_annotation(
      title = paste("Facet vs Individual Scaling"),
      theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5))
    )

  # Add extra padding around the combined plot
  combined_plot <- combined_plot & theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5), "cm"))

  # Save the combined plot
  ggsave(
    filename = paste0(region, "_comparison_plot.png"),
    plot = combined_plot,

When we compare mini plot from faceted chart (y-axis in **millions**) against individually scaled chart where the y-axis is now in **thousands**. 

You will see striking difference in visual representation of the refugee crisis in each of these regions, after the **y-axis scale** is adjusted.

This is just an instance where visualizations can be manipulated to fit one's story @cr-notes

Deliberately not rectifying the misleading Y-axis scaling can show the worst humanitarian crisis as just a flat line on a chart, or overhype a small, insignificant change as a dramatic shift.

Also, this was just an example, you can adopt this to scaremonger your audience to not get vaccinated.

To ditch their carbohydrates completely.

Throw away their aluminium utensils.

And persuade them to discontinue their anxiety medications and so on...
